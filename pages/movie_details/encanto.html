        <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
        <p><strong>Encanto</strong> is a 2021 American computer-animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation 
            Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The 60th film produced by the studio, it was 
            directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, who co-wrote the screenplay with 
            Bush, and produced by Yvett Merino and Clark Spencer, with original songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The film stars 
            the voices of Stephanie Beatriz, María Cecilia Botero, John Leguizamo, Mauro Castillo, Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda, 
            Carolina Gaitán, Diane Guerrero, and Wilmer Valderrama. Encanto follows a multigenerational Colombian family, 
            the Madrigals, led by a matriarch (Botero) whose children and grandchildren—except for Mirabel Madrigal 
            (Beatriz)—receive magical gifts from a miracle that helps them serve the people in their rural community called 
            the Encanto. When Mirabel learns that the family is losing their magic, she sets out to find out what is happening, 
            and save her family and their magical house.</p>
